After a mvn clean, the target\r\nfolders are recreated, and the plugin will help to mark these new folders as derivated.\r\n\r\nTo install the plugin, copy the latest jar-file under plugins/ to your Eclipse plugins/ folder. Restart Eclipse.\r\n","google":"","name":"Eclipse plugin target derivator"}
